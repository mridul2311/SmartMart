# SmartMart
- The current online shopping system does not provide the actual shopping experience to the users where they just scroll through the webpage and select an item they need to purchase which becomes monotonous too soon. We propose a 3D shopping system where the user can navigate through the shopping mart and interact with the items as they would in real life. The proposed system has various aspects interfaced with it.

- The front end is the actual environment where the user interacts and explores the shopping mart. 
- MySQL database is used to store the inventory, the customer details and the billing information.
-  Shopping is made more efficient and seamless with the integration of the recommendation system where various products get recommended taking into account the usersâ€™ purchase history.
